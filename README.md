I programmed and automated administration tasks via shell scripting/python/PowerShell programming languages, providing information on identities and clients around the globe. I acted as a designer/programmer helping and assessing the daily operation on solving issues by programming fast and low-cost solutions and alleviating employees’ workload. Finally, there are many other tasks involved in this position related to ITIL and IT good practices that leverage compliance rules and regulations in the client’s operation.
