I have achieved many automation solutions to provide automatic reconciliation and data extracting from Secret Management Platforms. I served as an SME individual by assisting ROCHE’s global employee at solving various types of incidents. I created reports based on ticketing systems and particular requests on RDBMSs daily. I programmed and automated administration tasks via shell scripting/python/PowerShell programming languages, providing information on identities and clients around the globe. I acted as a designer/programmer helping and assessing the daily operation on solving issues by programming fast and low-cost solutions and alleviating employees’ workload. Finally, there are many other tasks involved in this position related to ITIL and IT good practices that leverage compliance rules and regulations in the client’s operation.

Automated required processes using Unix shell scripting and technologies used in the Oracle Retail Suite implementation.

I managed databases for Nokia’s/Siemens’ traffic statistics, analysed performance indicators (KPIs) of the NOC and contributed in the KPIs co-designing for basic indicators of the daily operations.
